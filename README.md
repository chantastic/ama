Hey!

I get a lot of questions over email and twitter.  
Here I can answer those questions in a more public forum ðŸ¤—

Anything means *anything*. Personal questions. Money. Work. Life. Code. Whatever.

### Guidelines

- Ensure your question hasn't already been answered.
- Use a succinct title and description.
- Support questions are better asked on Stack Overflow.
- Please be civil.
